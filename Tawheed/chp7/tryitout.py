#A store is having a sale. They’re giving 10 percent off purchases of $10 or lower, and 20 percent off purchases of greater than $10.
#Write a program that asks the purchase price and displays the discount (10% or 20%) and the final price.


#A soccer team is looking for girls from ages 10 to 12 to play on their team.
#Write a program to ask the user’s age and if male or female (using “m” or “f”). Display a message indicating whether the person is eligible to play on the team.
#Bonus: Make the program so that it doesn’t ask for the age unless the user is a girl.


#You’re on a long car trip and arrive at a gas station. It’s 200 km to the next station. Write a program to figure out if you need to buy gas here, or if you can wait for the next station.
#The program should ask these questions:
#■ How big is your tank, in liters?
#■ How full is your tank (in percent—for example, half full = 50)?
#■ How many km per liter does your car get? The output should
#look something like this:



#Make a program where the user has to enter a secret password to use the program.
#You’ll know the password, of course (because it’ll be in your code). But your friends
#will either have to ask you, guess the password, or learn enough Python to look at the code and figure it out!
#The program can be anything you want, including one you have already written,
#or just a simple one that displays a message like “You’re in!” when he enters the right password.
